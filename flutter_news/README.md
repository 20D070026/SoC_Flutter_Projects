In this project, we delved deeper into app development, and got to know more about the various widgets and applications of Flutter.

## About the App

In this app, we can see global news on the first screen. Various categories like business, entertainment, health, science, sports, technology etc are available, and on choosing one of these categories, we can view the global news related to these specific categories.

To fetch the news, we used an API called NewsAPI to send requests.
