# SoC_Flutter_Projects
The readme files containing the descriptions of the projects are present in their respective project folders.
Only the following folders contain a major project:
1) world_time
2) flutter_news
3) trial_adai_directory
 
 (the projects were made in this order)
  
  Rest others are just trial and error type, either made while learning or just me tinkering around.
